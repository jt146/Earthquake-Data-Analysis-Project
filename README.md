# Earthquake Data Analysis 1974-2024

### Objective
The goal of the project is to clean the earthquake data and analyze the trends on the different factors impacting the strength, frequency, and geographic distribution of the earthquakes with magnitudes above 6.0.

### Data
The dataset was retrieved from the [USGS Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). The criteria for the earthquake magnitudes were set from 6.0 to 10.0 and the dates were set from 1/1/1974 to 1/1/2024.

### Tools Used
Python for Data Cleaning, Python (Matplotlib) and Tableau for Data Analysis and Visualization
